   <li> <b> Adam Smith’s pin factory: Division of labor: </b> Key points: specialize in sub-tasks. 1 person 1 pin per day to 1 person 4800 pins per day when 10 people operate in division of labor. </li> 

   <li> <b> David Ricardo’s comparative advantage: </b>
    Comparative advantage is an economic theory created by British economist David Ricardo in the 19th century. It argues that countries can benefit from trading with each other by focusing on making the things they are best at making, while buying the things they are not as good at making from other countries.</li> 

   <li> <b> Tragedy of the commons </b> 
    A situation where individuals, acting in their own self-interest, overexploit a shared resource, leading to its depletion and ultimately harming everyone who relies on it, even if they act responsibly; essentially, the unrestricted access to a common resource results in its destruction due to excessive use by individuals seeking personal gain. </li>
