    <p> Evolution from E-commerce to Agentic commerce (A-commerce) and its implications on the stakeholders </p> 
   
    <p> A-commerce is a fundamental shift in the retail operating system, not only an incremental upgrade of e-commerce. While e-commerce moved stores onto screens, a-commerce introduces a personal, AI-powered buying agent into everyday life. </p>
   
    <p> A-commerce can handle end-to-end purchase with only two customer inputs, intent and final selection, due to its reasoning and agentic capabilities. For example, if a customer says they want to plan for attending a wedding in Hawaii next month, the agent can infer the need for flights, hotel, and summer formal wear. It then presents curated options for each category. Once the customer makes selections, the agent completes the checkout.</p>
   
    <p> In a-commerce, a shopping funnel would be shared between agentic ai at the front end and retailer at the back end. Vs earlier, when retailers owned the whole funnel. This offers new opportunities to the agentic ai interface and challenges to retailers. </p>
 

    <p> <b> Impact on customers, retailers, and Agentic AI platforms </b> </p> 
    <p> a. Customers: Customers no longer start their shopping search on landing pages of retailers like amazon or walmart. Instead, the customer's shopping funnel starts and stays, from start to finish, within the agentic ai interface. AI interface would search and compare products based on customer intent and constraints, and also handle checkout. </p>

    <p> Customers would interact with the front end agentic ai interface while retailers would disappear in the back end and act as a database. Customers would also get access to multiple retailers from one tab in a-commerce vs being confined to a single platform from one tab in e-commerce. </p>
    
    <p> Customer’s net time in the shopping funnel would reduce drastically as ai will do the time-consuming grunt work of searching and comparing. Customer’s cognitive effort would also reduce and that can make shopping even more fun for the customers.</p>

    <p> b. Retailers: A-commerce represents a major challenge for retailers. Retailers would need to rethink their strategy to optimize for AX (agent experience) instead of CX (customer experience) as their data will be consumed directly by machines without human eyes checking their site or pages. They would need to move from optimizing for human dopamine to satisfy logical constraints. </p>
     
    <p> In a-commerce, UI (user interface) designed for humans will be ineffective as customers will skip visiting their site. Retailers would need to optimize for GEO (generative engine optimization) instead of SEO (search engine optimization) as their product data and metadata would be consumed by machines. They need to optimize their data and tech stack for a-commerce API (application programming interface) and protocols to deliver real-time and accurate results with speed. For example, retailers need to provide real-time inventory data so they wouldn’t promise products when they are actually out of stock. Recommender systems used to upsell, cross-sell, and influence impulse purchase in e-commerce would be ineffective in a-commerce. [1]</p>
     
    <p> Retailers risk losing critical insights due to lack of visibility into end-to-end customer shopping journey data in a-commerce. For example, null search data is used by retailers to diagnose assortment gaps. Retailer’s platform loyalty will erode as customers would access their data via agentic ai’s api calls instead of direct site visit. Retailers would also have difficulty in assessing CLV (customer lifetime value) without full visibility into customer interaction data.</p>
     
    <p> Ad dollars will shift from retailer owned sites to front-end ai interface, following customer glance views and time on the site. Their products would also compete against a wider pool of products from multiple other retailers for few spots, resulting in price competition and potential margin erosion. </p>

    <p> c. Agentic AI platforms: A-commerce represents a major opportunity for agentic ai players.
     Agentic ai platforms will sit at the top of the shopping funnel, which is high-intent and high-value, as both interface and gatekeeper, unlocking multiple revenue streams. These include advertising, platform fee (fixed or %), fee based on back-end api calls [2], and monetization of product search data and insights. </p>
     
    <p> Agentic ai interfaces will effectively become the new storefronts, while retailers increasingly being pushed into the back end role of managing selection, maintaining product catalog data, and operating physical infrastructure (FC, supply chain) and customer service. </p>
     
    <p> Tech firms will compete among themselves to become preferred agentic ai interface. Their differentiation will be driven by who can woo the customer by providing a native shopping experience (rather than throwing results in table format), end-to-end shopping experience within one tab, depth and quality of selection (partnership with key retailers), and the speed and accuracy of recommendations. Tech firms such as google, microsoft, openai, perplexity, anthropic have already entered the space, and other tech firms are likely to compete aggressively to become a dominant a-commerce portal. </p>


    <p> <b> The evolving A-commerce ecosystem </b> </p>  
    <p> New technical frameworks are emerging to support and standardize a-commerce. </p>
    
    <p> The MCP (model context protocol), launched by microsoft and google, provides a communication layer between ai agents and retailer databases. With MCP, retailers don’t need to connect their databases to individual ai interfaces. They can directly hook their data to MCP and then their data will be discoverable by all the ai interfaces. MCP also allows retailers to keep control over their core business logic (pricing, inventory, and catalog) by letting them keep it in their own systems without the need to put it on ai. </p>
    
    <p> Google had developed UCP (universal commerce protocol) in collaboration with retailers (walmart, shopify, wayfair etc.) and payment partners (visa, mastercard etc.) to standardize the broader a-commerce workflow. It leverages MCP as a communication layer and other protocols like A2A (agent2agent) as payment layer. Thus, UCP covers the entire a-commerce workflow from product discovery, cart management, checkout, and post-purchase tracking. While google currently allows retailers to keep the data in UCP, it may change when its gatekeeping power grows over retailers. </p> 
    
    <p> Visa and mastercard have launched “agent pay” that enables ai agents to complete transactions securely using tokenized credentials without exposing underlying card details. </p>
 

    <p> <b> Summary </b> </p>
    <p> A-commerce presents many opportunities for agentic ai platforms while challenges to retailers. Agentic ai platforms will act as front end of shopping while retailers will act as back-end infrastructure for ai agents and risk being largely invisible to the customers. Customers will benefit from significant time savings, reduced cognitive efforts, and a larger pool of products to choose from across multiple retailers. </p>


    <p> <b> Notes </b> </p>
    <p> [1] E-commerce uses recommendations across the customer journey to influence buying, Home pages use ‘trending now’, ‘best seller’ for new customers; and ‘Pick up where you left off’ and ‘inspired by your recent history’ for returning customers. Product detail pages use ‘similar products’ to cross-sell and ‘frequently bought together’ to bundle or upsell. Checkout pages use low cost products in ‘people also bought these accessories’ to induce impulse purchase. </p>

     <p> [2] Moving away from CPC (cost per click) to CPAC (cost per api call) as retailer’s data will not be clicked by humans directly in search and compare steps but accessed by agentic ai’s api calls in the back end. </p>
